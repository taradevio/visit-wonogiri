# Visit Wonogiri

## Description
This project is aimed to redesign and simplify the user experiences of the official Wonogiri Website. The official website itself has already been presented in a good way. However, there are some issues which are: 
- Several cluttered user interfaces
- Unmanageable categories as there are some categores having no items
- Unhandled contents with little information

Based on the problems above, I decided to work on:
- Simplified user interface
- Manageable categories
- Proper contents, providing information, such as description, images, and map
Whilst these are the basic solutions, I could improve further in the future by adding more features, such as search, filter, categories, and better UI for user experiences
