            A salad is a dish consisting of mixed ingredients, frequently
            vegetables. They are typically served chilled or at room
            temperature, though some can be served warm. Condiments and salad
            dressings, which exist in a variety of flavors, are used to make a
            salad.

          Garden salads use a base of leafy greens such as lettuce, arugula or
          rocket, kale or spinach; they are common enough that the word salad
          alone often refers specifically to garden salads. Other types include
          bean salad, tuna salad, bread salad (such as fattoush, panzanella),
          vegetable salads without leafy greens (such as Greek salad, potato
          salad, coleslaw), rice-, pasta- and noodle-based salads, fruit salads
          and desserts. Salads may be served at any point during a meal:</p>
          <br />
          <p class="sm:text-xl leading-relaxed">Appetizer salads - light, smaller-portion salads served as the first
          course of the meal Side salads - to accompany the main course as a
          side dish; examples include potato salad and coleslaw Main course
          salads - usually containing a portion of one or more high-protein
          foods, such as eggs, legumes, or cheese Dessert salads - sweet salads
          containing fruit, gelatin, sweeteners or whipped cream When a sauce is
          used to flavor a salad, it is generally called a dressing; most salad
          dressings are based on either a mixture of oil and vinegar or a creamy
          dairy base.
